## MonsterMash
#### Northcoders Final Project

Front end for my final project at Northcoders. An React app which uses Bulma for styling using a REST api served by the backend which is found [here](https://github.com/ChrstnDmbchr/be-monstermash) for it's data. 

Bootstrapped using `create-react-app`

Now hosted on [Heroku](https://aqueous-springs-80875.herokuapp.com/)
