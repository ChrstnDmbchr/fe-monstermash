## MonsterMash
#### Northcoders Final Project

Monster Mash is an anonymous, collaborative drawing mashup app. 

This repository is the front end for my final project at Northcoders. It uses a REST api served by the backend which is found [here](https://github.com/ChrstnDmbchr/be-monstermash) for it's data. 

Bootstrapped using `create-react-app`

### Installing

Download or clone this repository and run `npm i` to install all dependancies. Run `npm start` to serve the application.

Should you wish to change the URL at which the api calls are made to, in the `lib` folder and in the `api.js` file, change the string stored in the variable `rootURL` to the URL required.
